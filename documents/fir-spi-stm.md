# ASIC FPGA Prototyping - FIR Filter, SPI, STM32 Microcontroller

## Overview
In this lab you will be creating an SPI peripheral that will send and receive digital audio samples. These samples will be passed through a fir filter before being sent back and played. We will be using the STM32 development board from ECE 362 to capture and replay the audio.

## Required Materials
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- 1 Aux cord
- Another Aux cord/Headphones

## Create the STM32 Audio Input/Output Circuit
Follow the provided schematic to wire up the STM32 Audio input and output circuit. It is okay to use a TRS connector if you do not have a TRRS connector.
